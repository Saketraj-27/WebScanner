XSS Guard - Test URLs for Scanning

Safe Public URLs (Low Risk, Good for Baseline Testing):
1. https://example.com - Simple static page, should score low on XSS detection.
2. https://httpbin.org/html - Returns a basic HTML page with some inline scripts.
3. https://news.ycombinator.com - Real website with dynamic content (use with caution for rate limiting).

XSS Test Pages (For Vulnerability Detection Testing):
1. https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet - OWASP's comprehensive XSS evasion cheatsheet (educational, contains examples).
2. https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting - PortSwigger's XSS documentation page.
3. http://testphp.vulnweb.com/xss/example1.php?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script> - Vulnweb test page (if accessible).

Vulnerable Web Application URLs (For Thorough Testing):
1. http://dvwa.local/vulnerabilities/xss_r/ - Damn Vulnerable Web Application XSS reflected vulnerability (requires local DVWA setup).
2. http://dvwa.local/vulnerabilities/xss_s/ - DVWA stored XSS vulnerability.

Custom Test URLs (Create Your Own):
- A page with <script>alert('XSS')</script> in the body.
- A page with javascript:alert('XSS') in links.
- A page using innerHTML with user input.

Note: Always ensure you have permission to scan any URL, especially production websites. For development testing, start with local or controlled environments. The scanner will analyze static content (HTML, scripts) and dynamic behavior (DOM mutations, redirects) to assign a risk score.
