XSS Guard - Test URLs for Scanning

Safe Public URLs (Low Risk, Good for Baseline Testing):
1. (low threat detection) https://example.com - Simple static page, should score low on XSS detection.
2. (low threat detection) https://httpbin.org/html - Returns a basic HTML page with some inline scripts.
3. (low threat detection) https://news.ycombinator.com - Real website with dynamic content (use with caution for rate limiting).
4. (critical threat detection) http://testphp.vulnweb.com/xss/example1.php?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>  Vulnweb test page (if accessible).
5. (medium threat detection) https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet.html

Custom Test URLs (Create Your Own):
- A page with <script>alert('XSS')</script> in the body.
- A page with javascript:alert('XSS') in links.
- A page using innerHTML with user input.

Note: Always ensure you have permission to scan any URL, especially production websites. For development testing, start with local or controlled environments. The scanner will analyze static content (HTML, scripts) and dynamic behavior (DOM mutations, redirects) to assign a risk score.
